# Laravel Challenge: API Controller - Voices

This is a Controller code that needs to be improved, in whatever way possible.

Author's question: "how to make clean code to this code"
Source: [Youtube comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc8Ks3ElGmM&lc=Ugw_mwNX5Als7nfFvat4AaABAg)

This repository is not a full Laravel project, just that one Controller file.
Your task is to improve the code, by submitting a Pull Request.

---

## Rules: How to perform the task

I will be expecting a Pull Request to the `main` branch, containing **all** fixes with completely working project.

If you don't know how to contribute a PR, here's [my video with instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEcT6JIFji0).

**Important**: I will NOT merge the Pull Request, only comment on it, whether it's correct or not.

With my limited time, I will probably personally review first 10 Pull Requests, all the others will still get "karma points" by doing a good job to help the author.

If you have any questions, or suggestions for the future challenges, please open an Issue.

Good luck!
